# 🔌 API & Events Reference Guide

This document outlines the strictly-typed contracts established between **Next.js** $\rightarrow$ **Orchestrator** $\leftrightarrow$ **Inference Engine**.

> **Standardized Safety**: Since the Mono-Refinement, every API payload is validated at the gateway level using **`@matcha/contracts`**. If a payload does not strictly match the Zod schema, the request is rejected with a 400 Bad Request before hitting the service logic.

## 1. Orchestrator API (NestJS — Port 4000)

These are operations exposed primarily to the Frontend Client (Next.js).

### `POST /matches`
Initiates a new video processing task.
- **Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>`
- **Content-Type**: `multipart/form-data`
- **Body**:
  - `file`: `(Binary)` The video file (e.g. .mp4, .mov, .mkv). Max 5GB.
  - `title`: `(String)` Optional display title.
- **Response**: `201 Created`
  ```json
  {
      "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "status": "UPLOADED",
      "uploadUrl": "http://localhost:4000/uploads/1708532400000-match.mp4",
      "progress": 0,
      "duration": 0,
      "createdAt": "2024-02-21T18:30:00.000Z"
  }
  ```
  > After the 201 response, the orchestrator immediately fires `triggerInference()` in the background with up to 5 retry attempts (exponential backoff: 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s).

### `GET /matches`
Retrieves all matches for the authenticated user, ordered by most recent.
- **Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>`
- **Response**: `200 OK` — Array of match objects with event and highlight counts.
  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": "550e8400-...",
      "status": "COMPLETED",
      "progress": 100,
      "duration": 5400.0,
      "createdAt": "2024-02-21T18:30:00.000Z",
      "_count": {
        "events": 12,
        "highlights": 5
      }
    }
  ]
  ```

### `GET /matches/:id`
Retrieves fully analyzed data for a specific match including all events, highlights, emotion scores, and analytics fields. Applies user possession checks via context.
- **Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>`
- **Response**: `200 OK` — Full match detail object.
  ```json
  {
      "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "status": "COMPLETED",
      "progress": 100,
      "uploadUrl": "http://localhost:4000/uploads/match.mp4",
      "duration": 5400.0,
      "summary": "A pulsating 90-minute encounter that saw relentless pressure from both sides...",
      "highlightReelUrl": "http://localhost:4000/uploads/highlight_reel_550e8400.mp4",
      "trackingData": [
          { "t": 0.0, "b": [[0.51, 0.62, 0.03, 0.04, 0.88]], "p": [[0.3, 0.5, 0.08, 0.2, 1, 0]] }
      ],
      "teamColors": [[220, 50, 50], [50, 80, 220]],
      "heatmapUrl": "http://localhost:4000/uploads/heatmap_550e8400.png",
      "topSpeedKmh": 78.4,
      "events": [
          {
              "id": "evt-001",
              "timestamp": 42.5,
              "type": "GOAL",
              "confidence": 0.95,
              "finalScore": 9.2,
              "commentary": "GOAAAL! What a thunderous strike! The ball cannons into the top right corner..."
          }
      ],
      "emotionScores": [
          {
              "timestamp": 30.0,
              "audioScore": 0.72,
              "motionScore": 0.65,
              "contextWeight": 0.65,
              "finalScore": 6.8
          }
      ],
      "highlights": [
          {
              "startTime": 32.5,
              "endTime": 62.5,
              "score": 9.2,
              "eventType": "GOAL",
              "commentary": "GOAAAL! What a thunderous strike...",
              "videoUrl": null
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

### `DELETE /matches/:id`
Permanently deletes a match and all related records (events, highlights, emotion scores) from the database. Requires JWT possession verification.
- **Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>`
- **Response**: `200 OK` — `{ "ok": true }`

### `POST /matches/:id/reanalyze`
Wipes all previous analysis results and re-triggers the inference pipeline on the original uploaded video. The match status is reset to `PROCESSING` and progress to `0`. Previous `heatmapUrl`, `topSpeedKmh`, `summary`, and all events are cleared.
- **Response**: `200 OK` — `{ "ok": true }`

## 2. Orchestrator WebSocket Events (Socket.IO — Port 4000)

Clients connect to `ws://localhost:4000` and join a match-specific room by emitting `joinMatch` with the match ID. All match-specific events are scoped to that room.

### Client → Server

#### `joinMatch`
Joins the real-time room for a specific match to receive live analysis updates.
```json
{ "matchId": "550e8400-..." }
```

#### `leaveMatch`
Leaves the match room.
```json
{ "matchId": "550e8400-..." }
```

### Server → Client

#### `progress`
Emitted continuously as the Python inference engine processes video frames. Fired approximately every 5 processed frames.
```json
{
    "matchId": "550e8400-...",
    "progress": 45
}
```
- `progress` ranges from `0` to `100`. A value of `-1` signals a fatal processing failure (match status will be `FAILED`).

#### `matchEvent`
Emitted immediately (fire-and-forget) when Phase 2 detects an event during processing — before the full analysis completes. This allows the frontend to populate the event feed in real-time while the video is still being processed.
```json
{
    "matchId": "550e8400-...",
    "event": {
        "timestamp": 42.5,
        "type": "GOAL",
        "confidence": 0.95,
        "finalScore": 9.2,
        "commentary": "GOAAAL! A breathtaking late winner...",
        "source": "soccernet"
    }
}
```

#### `complete`
Emitted when Phase 4 synthesis is complete and all data has been saved to the database. The frontend should re-fetch `GET /matches/:id` after receiving this to load the full payload including analytics, highlight reel URL, heatmap, and team colours.
```json
{
    "matchId": "550e8400-...",
    "eventCount": 12,
    "highlightCount": 5
}
```

## 3. Inference Engine API (FastAPI — Port 8000)

Operations exposed natively *(Orchestrator $\rightarrow$ Python)*. These are internal endpoints not intended to be called directly by the frontend.

### `GET /health`
Health check endpoint. Returns `200 OK` if the inference service is running.
- **Response**: `{ "status": "ok", "service": "inference" }`

### `POST /api/v1/analyze`
Triggers the main 5-phase inference pipeline asynchronously using FastAPI `BackgroundTasks`. Returns immediately with `202 Accepted` — the actual analysis runs in the background.
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **Body**:
  ```json
  {
      "match_id": "550e8400-...",
      "video_url": "/absolute/filesystem/path/to/match.mp4"
  }
  ```
  > Note: `video_url` is a **filesystem path**, not an HTTP URL. The orchestrator passes the local file path, while the publicly-accessible URL is stored separately in `uploadUrl`.
- **Response**: `200 OK`
  ```json
  { "status": "processing", "match_id": "550e8400-..." }
  ```

---

## 4. Orchestrator Internal Callbacks (Port 4000)

Private routes called by the Python inference engine to push updates back to NestJS during analysis. These are fire-and-forget from Python's perspective (1–2 second timeouts).

### `POST /matches/:id/progress`
Updates processing progress and broadcasts via WebSocket.
- **Body**: `{ "progress": 45 }` — Integer 0–100. `-1` signals failure.

### `POST /matches/:id/live-event`
Immediately broadcasts a newly-detected event via WebSocket to all connected frontend clients watching this match. The event is **not** saved to the database here — only broadcast. Final persistence happens in `complete`.
- **Body**:
  ```json
  {
      "timestamp": 42.5,
      "type": "GOAL",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "finalScore": 9.2,
      "commentary": "GOAAAL!",
      "source": "soccernet"
  }
  ```

### `POST /matches/:id/complete`
Called once at the end of Phase 4 (after highlight reel generation). Saves all analysis results to PostgreSQL in a single Prisma `$transaction` and broadcasts the `complete` WebSocket event to connected clients.
- **Body** (full payload):
  ```json
  {
      "events": [
          {
              "timestamp": 42.5,
              "type": "GOAL",
              "confidence": 0.95,
              "finalScore": 9.2,
              "commentary": "GOAAAL! A thunderous late winner..."
          }
      ],
      "highlights": [
          {
              "startTime": 32.5,
              "endTime": 62.5,
              "score": 9.2,
              "eventType": "GOAL",
              "commentary": "GOAAAL!..."
          }
      ],
      "emotionScores": [
          {
              "timestamp": 30.0,
              "audioScore": 0.72,
              "motionScore": 0.65,
              "contextWeight": 0.65,
              "finalScore": 6.8
          }
      ],
      "duration": 5400.0,
      "summary": "A pulsating 90-minute encounter...",
      "highlightReelUrl": "http://localhost:4000/uploads/highlight_reel_550e.mp4",
      "trackingData": [{ "t": 0.02, "b": [], "p": [] }],
      "teamColors": [[220, 50, 50], [50, 80, 220]],
      "heatmapUrl": "http://localhost:4000/uploads/heatmap_550e8400.png",
      "topSpeedKmh": 78.4
  }
  ```

## 5. Event Types Reference

The following `EventType` enum values are valid across all endpoints:

| Type | Weight (0–10) | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GOAL` | 10.0 | GoalDetectionEngine / SoccerNet | Ball crossed the goal line |
| `PENALTY` | 9.5 | SoccerNet | Penalty kick awarded |
| `RED_CARD` | 9.0 | SoccerNet | Player sent off |
| `SAVE` | 8.0 | SoccerNet / Vision AI | Goalkeeper saves a shot |
| `YELLOW_CARD` | 7.0 | SoccerNet | Player booked |
| `CELEBRATION` | 6.5 | SoccerNet / Vision AI | Players celebrating |
| `FOUL` | 6.0 | SoccerNet | Foul committed |
| `HIGHLIGHT` | 5.5 | Motion Fallback | Generic high-action moment |
| `TACKLE` | 5.0 | SoccerNet / Vision AI | Physical challenge for the ball |
| `CORNER` | 4.0 | SoccerNet | Corner kick |
| `OFFSIDE` | 2.5 | SoccerNet | Offside flag raised |

---

## 6. Context Score Formula

Every detected event is assigned a `finalScore` (0–10) via `compute_context_score()`:

```
ew    = EVENT_WEIGHTS[type] / 10.0          # event type weight
audio = min(motionScore × 1.3, 1.0)         # motion-derived audio intensity proxy
tw    = time_context_weight(timestamp)       # temporal weight (late game = higher)
base  = (ew × 0.40) + (audio × 0.20) + (motionScore × 0.25) + (tw × 0.15)
score = base × (0.5 + 0.5 × confidence)     # confidence scaling

# Special boosts:
if timestamp/duration > 0.85 and type == "GOAL":  score *= 2.0  # late goal
if timestamp/duration < 0.08 and type in ("SAVE", "TACKLE"):  score *= 1.3  # frantic start
```

Temporal weight table:

| Match Position | Weight |
|---|---|
| Injury time (>92%) | 1.00 |
| Final 10 min (>85%) | 0.95 |
| Last quarter (>70%) | 0.85 |
| Second half (>50%) | 0.75 |
| Around half-time (>45%) | 0.60 |
| First half | 0.65 |

## 7. Static File Serving

The Orchestrator serves uploaded videos, generated highlight reels, and heatmap images from the shared `/uploads/` directory at:
```
GET http://localhost:4000/uploads/<filename>
```

File naming conventions:
| File | Naming Pattern | Format |
|---|---|---|
| Uploaded match video | `{timestamp}-{original_name}.mp4` | MP4 |
| Compressed intermediate | `compressed_{matchId}.mp4` | MP4 (deleted after analysis) |
| Highlight reel | `highlight_reel_{matchId}.mp4` | MP4 |
| Player heatmap | `heatmap_{matchId}.png` | PNG (800×520px) |
| TTS audio clip | `temp_audio_{matchId}_{i}.wav` | WAV (deleted after muxing) |
